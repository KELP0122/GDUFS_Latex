# GDUFS_Latex v.1.0_beta
This is a LaTex template for homework or essay in GDUFS.

The black and white logo is from the word thesis performa from the official website. Theoretically, this template suites every major in GDUFS, except those courses which required students to use Microsoft Office. 

Please note that the performa of this template is not suitable for thesis.
It's recommended to interpret this project using Overleaf.(https://www.overleaf.com/)
The current vision supports Chinese, English and Japanese. And XeLaTex is recommended as option.
